eksi-engelle
============

This is a short guide for the eksi-engelle application to run.

Project Structure
-----------------
- eksi-engelle blocks all users (authors and readers) from favorite list of targeted entry by using selenium webdriver,

- shows the total blocked user count,

- blocks spesific suser.

Virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to Anaconda, you can also use ``virtualenv``, to define your
Python 3 environment. You are required to have a Python 3 installed in your
workstation.

You can find the `virtualenv installation procedure`_ on the PyPA website.

Once you've installed Python 3 and ``virtualenv``, you will have to setup a
``virtualenv`` environment:

.. code-block:: sh

  # navigate to the eksi-auto directory
  cd eksi-auto

  # create the virtual environment for eksi-engelle
  virtualenv -p YOUR_LOCAL_PYTHON3_PATH eksi_venv

  # activate the virtual environment
  source eksi_venv/bin/activate

You can deactivate the virtual environment with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

  deactivate

.. _`virtualenv installation procedure`: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

Please remember that you may have to reactivate the virtual environment if you
open a new Terminal or Command Prompt window, or restart your system.

After activated your virtual environment you can install eksi-engelle :

Running the Application
-----------------------

After eksi-engelle installation completed and geckodriver copied to correct folder you can run eksi-engelle.
